# Bamazon
This console app uses MySQL as a database to display a list of 10 items on your terminal.  Customer is then prompted to input items that they would like to purchase using the NPM Inquirer package.
The database is then updated (remove purchased items from MySQL inventory) and prompts the customer to continue shopping or to quit.

This is a very simple app that shows a small portion of the power of MySQL.

Some screenshots further exemplify how this app works.

Initial display of the database is accomplished usind "node bamazonCustmer.js" to give the following response.
Also, after the input of Soap and 5 the updated table is displayed.
